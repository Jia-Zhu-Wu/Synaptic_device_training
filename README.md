# synaptic device training method 
This project is designed for those who want to simulate synaptic devices (optical or electrical, RRAM, spintronic, FeRAM) using software.

I built the neural network model based on previous studies (as some papers did not provide their source code). Additionally, I created a GUI to lower the barriers for reading and running simulations. All references are included in the description.

If you have any questions, please contact me via email at allen569780b@gmail.com.
