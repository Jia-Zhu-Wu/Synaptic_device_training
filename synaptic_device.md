# Quantizaion synaptic device simulator 

This quantization‚Äëbased CNN model was developed by Jia‚ÄëZhe¬†Wu. It uses a straightforward quantization scheme to emulate the behavior of optical and electrical synaptic devices entirely in software.

Because the papers that inspired this work did not release source code, I combined several of their ideas and implemented a complete neural‚Äënetwork model, documenting every detail as thoroughly as possible. To help users who prefer not to read or write code, I also built a graphical user interface (GUI).

The current version employs simple linear quantization: weights are mapped to the range¬†[‚Äë1,¬†1], and only the fully connected layers are quantized. (In real spiking‚Äëneural‚Äënetwork hardware, precise synaptic devices suitable for CNN‚Äëbased SNNs are still lacking.)
